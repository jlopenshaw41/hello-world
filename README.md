My first GitHub repository

Hello!

I'm Jennifer and I'm learning to code. I've started with JavaScript and I'm following codecademy's course, with a bit of freeCodeCamp too. Maybe I'll do a bootcamp one day but for now I'm doing it at home when I can (i.e. when my two young boys let me!) Wish me luck!
